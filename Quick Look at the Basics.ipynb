    "# Coding with Python: A Quick Look at the Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started working with Python, you need to have an understanding of the basic building blocks of a script or program. Through this workbook, we will introduce some fundamental programming concepts that are important for any programming language, and how they look in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "Throughout the following code, you will see lines called *comments*, which begin with a `#` symbol. These lines provide important and useful context and information to a reader about what's going on in the code at that point. **They are ignored by the interpreter** and will not be run. You can also put a comment on the same line as code (at the end) and the interpreter will ignore anything *after* the `#` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "In Python, much like with other languages, information (data) is stored in 'containers' called *variables*. These variables can hold a single piece of data (a number, word, etc) or a collection of information. You put data into variables using `my_variable = ???`. Here, we'll put the number 2 into a variable called `travis`, and then have the notebook display the value of that variable."

    "## Data Types\n",
    "As you know, data comes in many flavours. When we talk about different flavours of data in Python, we use the key term `type` to describe that data. Data comes in many differen forms, which we can roughly divide into the following rough categories:\n",
    "* Numbers (integers, floating-point decimal numbers, complex)\n",
    "* Strings (letters, words)\n",
    "* Booleans (True/False)\n",
    "* Data structures (lists, dictionaries, classes)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that Python features is *dynamic typing*, which means you are allowed to put **different types of data into the same container name**. Other languages require that you declare what type of data goes in a container when you first create it. Can you think of some possible reasons why this might be good, and might be problematic?"

    "## Indentation and Scope\n",
    "Like most programming languages, Python files, workbooks, or command line inputs are just a set of instructions for the computer to follow (and they will follow them literally, the exact same way every time). In order to divide up our code into smaller pieces that we may want to run multiple times, or gatekeep behind a certain set of criteria, we use indentation. While Python is pretty good at interpreting indentation levels if they are consistent, save yourself some trouble and **always indent with four (4) spaces**, not tabs, or two spaces, or anything else. Four spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we indent code, we are doing what's called *changing scope*. That means the code in the *narrower* scope doesn't always have access to the information outside of its current scope. Python's use of scope is more fluid than other programming languages, but it's something to be aware of, especially if you re-use variable names or placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops: Run the same code again and again\n",
    "In many cases, we want to run the same set of instructions multipe times. For example, we want to add some values together, then check if they are at a certain threshold, then do something if that's true, and if not add some more numbers to them. To run the same set of code over and over again we use *loops*. There are two types of loops you can use in Python: `while` loops and `for` loops. You can do everything you need to do with `for` loops, so we'll focus on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing a `for` loop needs is a set of instructions for how many times to run. In Python, this is done by *iterating* through a collection of objects. We can provide the set of objects ourselves, or we can use some handy tools to generate these collections programatically. Let's have a look at both:"
